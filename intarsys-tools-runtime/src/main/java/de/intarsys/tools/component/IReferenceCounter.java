/**
 * An object that is aware of its referents.
 * <p>
 * The object implements a reference counting mechanism that should behave like
 * this:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>the object should keep a counter that increments when acquired and
 * decrements when released</li>
 * <li>upon creation the object should be acquired by the constructor or factory
 * method.</li>
 * <li>if the client code is not aware if a new object is created (or taken from
 * a registry for example), the object published by the factory method should
 * always be acquired.</li>
 * <li>the object should not accept method calls before it is acquired</li>
 * <li>when the counter is zero after release, the object should no longer
 * accept any calls</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If combined with the {@link INotificationSupport}, the object MAY trigger an
 * {@link AttributeChangedEvent} upon acquire/release. In this case the
 * <code>ATTR_REFERENCECOUNT</code> should be used to indicate the attribute.
 * <p>
 * If combined with the {@link INotificationSupport}, the object MAY trigger a
 * {@link DestroyedEvent} when the reference count reaches 0.
