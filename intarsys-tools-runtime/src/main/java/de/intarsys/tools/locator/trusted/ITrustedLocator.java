/**
 * This {@link ILocator} guarantees that a change to its physical resource while
 * its is used by application code will be detected or healed.
 * <p>
 * This behavior is for example important for an application creating a
 * signature for a document, where it is crucial that no one will change the
 * data to be signed while the user verifies and accepts the original version.
 * <p>
 * An {@link ITrustedLocator} guarantess that
 * <ul>
 * <li>Any input stream acquired after the first input stream will read exactly
 * the same data OR fail.</li>
 * <li>If the client code changes data via an {@link OutputStream} or
 * {@link IRandomAccess} acquired from this {@link ITrustedLocator}, the new
 * data stream will become valid at least after a "close" or "flush" operation.
 * After the data is written to the physical resource it will contain exactly
 * the new data where changed and exactly the old data where not. Otherwise the
 * write will fail. Subsequent input stream will read the new data as described
 * above.</li>
 * <li>These constraints provide secure access from on the first read/write
 * access to the resource. Sometimes a resource must be "freezed" before a
 * physical access is done. This can be achieved by calling "checkpoint". An
 * access to the resource after "checkpoint" behaves as described above, but the
 * {@link ITrustedLocator} is free to implement "checkpoint" in a more
 * performant way.</li>
 * </ul>
